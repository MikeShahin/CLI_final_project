## Intro

REL-Event is the newest events finding app capitalizing on the hot new craze of command line apps! It is powered by  the Eventful api.

## Use/Features

This CLI app allows users to use keywords to search for any type of event they can imagine. The program takes a keyword (like concert, art, food, or even moms)and a location (can be a city, state, zip, country, etc) and presents the user with a list of events showing the title, time/date, and location. The user is then given the option to get more info on the event including a description and url. The user has the ability to save events they are interested in and the saved events will persist each time the user exits the program and can be re-loaded when the user re-starts. Much effort was put into finding any bugs that crashed the program and thus the user can endlessly loop through the many options without having the program crash on them. 

To use simply download this repository onto your local computer and in the command prompt first enter "bundle install" then enter "ruby bin/run.rb" at the root directory for the program.
